cloud run functions:

is a execution environment provided by cloud plotforms that enables run your code in responce to events withput managing by any underlying infrastrutures
1. Event driven execution 
2. Serverless 
3. pay as you go 
4. Languages support

it's a servicess computing build applications
Computing is analysis services 
Serverless is a compute come serverless 

#RUN your code with Zero servcer Management using scalable pay as you go functions services (FAAS)
